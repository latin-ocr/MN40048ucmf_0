Cn. vii-a 1. communem cansam· Of all 111οΡ111011.-
Veniamus. It is not unusual to pass from the singular to the plural.
And on the other hand the transition srorn the plural to the singular is

38. nostram. The cause of Ligarius. Having thus far related
the general charges against the Pompeians, he now shows in partien-
lar the snperiority of Ligarins's cause, because Tubero went to the
province when its fidelity to the republic was doubts ul3 aud sent by a
senate the organ 01 a party. Not so Ligarius-Utrum is the neuter
01 the adjective taken as the subject 01 facilius erse, and sarving to
introduce generally the question which follows. Ligarium and uos,

, therefore, which the MSS. give, are the true reading instead 01 Liga-

rio and velie. In this passage Orelli gives the punctuation proposed
by Madvig, who also (opusc. i. p. 159) advocates ueniam. The eorn-
1101 punctuation places a period after ael bostrom, and this is the
punctuation of Benecke, Klotz, Soldan, and even Madvig in his edi·
tiones the Oratione.

going into Africa—Si rae consulis, The expression is bonowed 11011

Cicero wishes always, as far as possible, to appear to be on the side 01
law and order, and therefore here, as also below, ch. 8, 23, he says,
he always regarded it as his duty to recognise the will 01 the senate,
thereby justisying his position in regard to Cesar.

41. nullomodo, sc. poteratis non venire—Senatus idem lego-
oerot. Idem qui Tuberonem in Africam miserat. cf. p. Legi Mori.

This was before the civil war commenced‚ when the senate still di-
rected the administration 01 affairs.

43. Tune paruistis. Tunc = turri-ee stands emphatically 101
