design to murder Caesar, when he was his guest in Gallograecia. and also 01
an intention ol sending troops to the 011101 Caecilius Bassus. Deiotarus sent
an enrhassy to Rome to look atter his interests, and with them his slave Phi-
dippus, who was at the same timo his physieian. But hc, while in ltome,
was corrupted by Castor, and appeared against his master. This embassy
waited ou Cicero, who readily uudertoolr the cause of his old friend, aud in
November 01 this year, beloto Ctesar in his own house, defended him iri the
following speech 01 Cicero's success we are not intormed ; but t'rom Pati.
2, 31, ut, it would appear that while Caesar lived, Deiotarus's circumstances
did not improve. Atterthe murder of Caesar, Hieras appears to have obtained
from Antony, through Fulvia, the restitution 01 his master’s dorniuions tor
lu,000,ttuu sesterces Deiotarus, however, had seized by soree on the territory
in question, as soon as he heard 01 Caesare death, and toolr revenge upon bis
son-in-law and daughter. He subsequently j0ined the party 01 Brutus and
Cassius, aud having attained an advaneed age, was succeeded by Deiotarus
tr, his only surviviug sou, all the rest 01 his children having been put to death
by him, according to Plutarch¹ in order that his kingdom, in the hands os his
successor, might not be shorn 01 its power.

1. ln the introduction the orator speahs 01 his embarrassment and confusion,
which he generally teels in important cases, and which is increased still
inore hythe circumstance. (1) that he has to defend a iring, and a king who
has done great service to the Roman people. 1105110012) he is agitated by
the cruelty and unworthiness 01 the two aceusers (1 1-31, and everi (311110
unusual constitution 01 1110 court, since the offended Caesar is at 1110 same
time judge; as lihewise (1) the place in which he must speak, a 10010 iu
Caesar's pataee, instead 011110 public 10101111 add to his embarrassment. Ι
(1 4-7.)

11. 1101010 replying to the charge and resuting 11, he speaks 01 the hope 01 the
accusers on which they relied. in the 1101101 that Caesar had not sincerety
pardoned Deiotarus, au opinion which is aliha inconsistent with the 001110
sentiments 01 cesarano with his previous expressions respecting the lring.
(11, 8.) By this he prepares the way tor the mention 01 what Deiotarus
had done (t) 101 Pompey, (1) 101 Caesar, and (3) how Caesar had 10001101
his endeavors. (19-15.)

ΙΙΙ. The simple statement is a resutiition 01 the charge: tor (1) so inconsid-
erate an net is at varianae 111111 1110 well-known prudenoe and character 01
the king (115.16); te) the whole accusation is aclumsy invention, nnd
every thing which has beeri brought lorward to prove tt, is utterly improba-
ble and absurd (1 17-22); (3) 1110 king had 110 wish 10 levy an army against
Caesar, as the accusers maintained (1 23, 24) ς (4) Deiotarus did not eherish
hostile feelings against Caesar (1 thum bnt (5) 11 was Castor 1011101, who
was so disposed (1 211, 29), who, ungratetul and treacherous (1 {tu-32), had
impudently fabricated a story, that Blesamius had hy letter conrmunieated
to the king, his master, something prejudicial 10 Ceasar, (1 33, tt.)

tv. The conclusion mentions the gratitude 01 1110 king. aud his eontentmeut
with Caesar’s treatment (1 35-39) 1 and seeks to erilist the sympathy aud ta-
vor 01 Oaesar in hehalt 01 the two kings, the tather and son.
