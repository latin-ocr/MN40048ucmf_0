¹4· [Domi] petimus. Since thre cause was argued in 111111011111111Ξὲε

it seems necessary ta erase domi, or read periimus. Madvig omits
dorni. Matthia defends the common text as spoken generally, re-
markiug that in what follows Cicero speaks of what was actually
done. Soldan with Klotz retains darni petimus, and considers with
Manutius the present as used for the perfect for the purpose of vivid-
ness of description. Benecke would read, Quod nos petimus . . . . ap·
pugnabis? . . ..repente irruisses . . . . misereatur .. . . Quanto hoe
durias, id teia foro oppugnare et in tali, due-Precilius, lacrimis.

16. Ne impetremus, pugnabis. Z. 543. Benecke, Klotz, and
Soldan read oppugnabis.

—Quod effecimus. See ad Fam. 6, 14.

19. Repente· The old reading is derepente, hut this form belongs
to earlier latinity‚ and is not elsewhere used by Cicero, nor here sus-
tained by the best uass-Irrapisses. Benecke would prefer irruireee,
which Madvig and Soldan, from Cari Eas. as shown hy Frenud, adopt.
irrumpere involves the notion of violence aud force, which here is
nat so suitable as the notion of rapidity and haste, which le contained
rather in irruissee.

20. Cave ignoscas. P. G. 5393 Z. 586.

21. misereat. Z. 441. Benecke, llladvig, and Saldae, mise-
reatur. Z. aie.

23. Te iu tau miseria. . . . tollere. The change from the
passive to the active construction has given offence here. Some have
therefore preferred ie . . ..oppugnare and tollera- others either tolli
or inultorum ie perfugiunt . . . . tallere. Such instances of enallage
are however elsewhere found. Orelli alone, so far as appears, and
without reason, changes the common reading et in tuli into te in
tali.

24. Perfugium misericordiae. The refuge ol mercy, i. e. the
refuge which the wretched fiad in Caesar's clemency. Compare note
on p. 26, line 16. In lllanil. t ³9 the construction is different
