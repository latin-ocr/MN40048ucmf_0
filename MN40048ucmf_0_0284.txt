The oration 101 Marcellus was spoken iu 1110 0011010, n. 0. c. ro& and was
the first which Cicero delivered after the dowufall 01 1110 republic. 1100111100-
quently written out and published, it was always admired as a finished dis·
course. “Cicera” says Middleton‚ “touched by the generosityof Caesar,
arrd greatly pleased with the 001 110011, 011 1110 account 01 1110 friend, returned
thanhs 10 him in a speech, which, though made upon 1110 01101, yet 101 010-
gance of diction, vivacity 01 sentiment, and politeness of compliment‚ is supe-

rior to any thing extant 011110 hind in all antiquins It has boen regarded aa
1110 model 01 Pliny’s Panegyric 01 Trajan ; and passages from it 010 quoted
and explained by Nouius Marcellus, Lactantius, aud Priscian, 00 well asin
the fragments 01 Commentarios 011 Cicero’s Orations, which have 00100 down
to us under the name of Asconius Pedianus

Notwithstandiug this, 11 10 maintained by F. A. Wolf, 11101 Cicero delivered
no oration 101 Marcellus, still less 11101 110 wrote 0110 0111; 0011, consequently‚
that the present oration 10 0 declamatory exercise 01 010101 period, perhaps 01
1110 agc 01 Τ111011110, shortly before 0000111110. This view was assailed by

by Passow aud Hand. independently 01 Jacob, Hug also, and after 11111180-
vels, who gave prominence to the testimony 01 Cicero himself, endeavored
to set 001110 1110 doubts respecting the genuineness 01 1110 present oration,
which Schiitz, and 0110111101 Orelli, who also directed attention 10 0011101
doubts 01 0 8110010111, John Andres, again condemned 00 spurious, though

ANALYSIS.

1. In the introduction Cicero declares his purpose 01 again appearing as an
oratoria publio ς and justifies his determination, partly by the 110οο101000
01111 extraordinary goodness of Caesar, partly by his joy upon the pardon 01 .
Marcellus, (1 1-1.)

2. The orator magnifies the clemency ot caesar, by comparing it 111111 1110
great achievements and victories, which latter must doubtless give place
to the former; for-
