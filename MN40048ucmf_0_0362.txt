THE ORATION FOR ΤΗΕ ΡΟΕΤ ARCHIAS.

lNTltODUCTION.

A. Lrorrvrus 11110111101101110111101000ῐεύ at Antioch in Syria, a city re
nowrred lor the cultivation os Greek art aud learning, acquircd at a very early
age a considerable reputation as a poet He had scarcely grown out 01 the ago
ol hoyhood, when, according to the sashion 01 1110 timo, he went out on ajonr-
ney, 1110 olp'cct 01 which was to improve hhrrsels and increase his knowledge.
He travelled through Asia hliuor aud Grcece, and thence to sorrttrern Italy,
where he visited the towns 01 Tarentum, Locri, Rhegium, aud Naplcs. llis
talcnt was everywhere recognised and appreciatcrl, aud the above-mentioned
towns attested their estimation by honoring him with 111011011011100, ln a. a. c.
651, 111 1110 consulship 01 C. Marius and Q. Lutatius Catulus, Archias carne to
Rorne3 he was received into the first samilies ot' the city, and cnjojrerl thc par-
ticular hospitality 01 the Luculli, in honor 01 which sarnily Archias also as-
sumed its gentile name Licinius. 110 Cicero calls him his instructor, ir would
seem that Archias, besides his poetical occupationS, also engaged at that time
in instructing young Romans. Some years later he accompauied L. Lucullus
on a Journey to Sicily, and on their return they pawed through Heraclia in
Lucania. T here, too, he vves, through the mediatiou 01 Lucullus, honored
with tho franchise; and this was the inore valuablc to him, as that town was
ina nearly eoiial legal relation to¹ and alliauce with, Rome, and as Archias
seems to have determinent to spond the remainder ot' his lile at llorrre. 111
a. u. o. ῦ115,111011111111100, 111. Plautius ¹Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo, brought
1111110111 a hill (les Plautio Papirio) hy which the franchise was conterred
1111011 all those who were enrolled as citizens in an allied town, proriam they
hau a donricile in ltaly at the time 011110 passing 01 the law, and gave 111 their
name to the pretor witlrin sixty days. Archias tirlfilled these coraliticus, and
gave in his name 101 registratiou 10 1110 pretor Q. Metellus. But 111 ,1,0. c. hev,
a law was passed (lca Papio), euacting that all peregrini, or stratigius,
should he expelled 110111 1101110, and that the Socii Larini (who were not Ro
mau citizens) should he sent away to their native places. On that occasion a
certain Gratius, who may have been induced by hatred, 01 avarice, 01 hy en·
1111111 against Lucullus, came forward, awerting that Archias was a peregri-
nus, and had illegally assumed the narne ot' a Roman citizen. Archias was
unable to bring t'orward any evidence 01 his franchise, sortire archives 01 110-
raclia had been destroyed by rire. During his long stay at Rome, moreover,
he had never entered his name asacitizen in the census lists. Cicero now
undertoolr the del‘ence 01 his old teaclrer aud t‘rierrd; not, indeed, with a strict
legal argumentation, 101 the prools were waming, but he sets up the dignity
01 the acorrsed, the ati'ection hc had met with everywhere, and his services to
literature aml art, as so many proot's ol' the truth 01 his assertion that he was
in lawt'nl possession 01 1110 Roman t'rauchise; nay, Cicero rnaintains that 11
Archias were not already a Ronran citizen, his lit'e and rnerits made it a duty
101 Rome to adrnit him among the number 01 her citizens, in order to secure
a mau 01000110111111011οο101110000111101110001111. Such a deleuce, which
