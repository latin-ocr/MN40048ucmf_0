Cn. 1V.-o. In Siciliam profectus. The language shows that
Locallns must have had the province of Sicily, bnt nothing of this is
known from any other source. Senators were allowed to quit Italy
ior a certain tirne without any special commissiou. On their jonrney,
and wherever they stayed, they enjoyed the honors and distinctions of
real amhassadors, but more especially the hospitium publicam. It has
been thought, therefore, by sorne, to be more probahle that Lucullus,
ou the occasion here referred to, made use ot* this jur legationis libe·
ram sor a private purpose. Matthia thinks the niort-band irritet· nas
blnndered the passage, as the going to Sicily is made protrahent,
though it is quite secondary: one should haue expected, he says,
‘¹ ania ec provincia Sicilia ania L. Luenllo, praem ee concitatas
erat, decederet? But may nottho cataplimentory nature of the lact,
that Lucullus 1006 him aad l'ept bilo with hini, justisy the co-aidinate
(instead oi subordinate) positiones the taking him into Sicily? Mad-
