causes which led Clodius 10 attempt the life of 11110, Clodius wished to
be prator and 11110 consul for the same year. This was quite contrary to
the desires 01 Clodius. Clodius, therefore, did 001 attempt to conceal the
fact, that he wished, expected, and would bring about the death of 11110.
(Ch. 11.) Clodius took advantage of the occasion of a Journey, which 11110
1105 called 10 make on business, to lie in wait for him. The time and man·
ner of his Journey exonerate 1111011010 1110 suspicion of having intended 10
waylay Clodius; while Clodius appears 10 have been prepared 10 commit
murder, The altack commenccd against 11110, Several 01 his retinue were
slain 3 the rest supposed 11110 had already fallen, without his command or
knowledge they killed Clodius. [Cil. 11.)

(Chll.)

(c) The proposition that Clodius was the waylayer, is drawn 0111 more par·
ticularly.

(1) 1111015 death would bring great advantages 10 Clodius: under such a con-
sul as 11110, he would 001 have been able 10 carry through his projected law

dius, who, 101 1110 purpose 01 exciting the people, deprived the corpse 01
Clodius of honorable burial. (01111.)

'l'he hostility 01 Clodius was to Mile, on the other hand, in his canvassing
for the consulship, 00150 much a hinderance as 00 advantage, since 11110
seemed the only one capable 01 restraining, by means 01 1110 00050101 pow·

(1) Clodius has always loved and praclised violence, particularly in the ban-
ishment of Cicero. (Ch. 14.)

(5) 11110 00 the other hand has used violence only in defenoe of the constitu·
tion, and generally, where he has had an opportunity to kill Clodius, has
treated him with forbearance : e. g. on the occasion 01 Cicero's recall from
banishment, and in other disturbances. (Cn. la)

(1) Cato is witness, that Clodius said, 11110 must be put to 1100111, (Ch. 16.)

(11) Clodius knew that 11110 about this time would be passing 00 the rond in
this vicinity, and hasteried 10 precede him, even 10 the neglect 01 much in
Rome, 11110 did not know that he would meet Clodius: his journey was
necessary for the performaaae of an official duty connected with the rites
of religion. (Ch. 11.)

(111) Cicero, in his 01111 defence, urges. that he could have had no knowledge

entertained the murderoas design, so also does the retinue 01 both.
