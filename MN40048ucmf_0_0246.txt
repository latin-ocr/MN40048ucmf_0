(3.1 ue seehs to show that to no other general than Pornpey¹ who anites in him·
5011 all the 0110111105 01 a commander¹ can the command in this war be given
(121); 101 (0) 110 possessas tlic most accurate knowledge and experience 01

and Servile wars 1121131), and especially in the war against the pirates 1111-

cau besides best talre charge 01 11115 war as he is already in the neighborhood
0111, 1150.)

'Phe orator having sufficiently dwelt upon these points, proceeds to relate two
opposite opinions (1 51) :-

(l.) Tlrat 01 11011015105, who had objected that all power ought not to be con-
ierred upon oue tuan. Cicero weatrens this abjectiori by showing that 11 the
conduct 01 the war against the pirates, in accordance with this view 01 llorten-
51115, had not been given to l'ompey¹ the wellare 01 the Roman people, nay,
even its world supremacy would have been lost 11 sator. lle thus gives to his
own opinion greater weight, and casts suspicion upon that 01 Hortensius, as
opposed to the wellare 01 1110 state. lle further adds¹ what does not properly
form a part 0111115 cause, that some had unworthily opposed Gabinius in pre·
venting his appointment as legate to l’ompey, when he had been the proposer
01 the Len by which Pompey was charged with 1110 command 01 the war
against the pirates 11 ol, 18).

(2,) That 01 Catulus (to whom he testities his respect lor his merita) that such a
proceeding was contrary to the institutions 01 111011 1100510151 by showing, (a)
that the Roman people, lor its own advantage, had 011011 made exceptious and
put many wars in charge osone man 11611) 1 and 11) that Catulus himself bad
previously, to honor Pompeyy voted 101 extraordinary 1001511105, Praise of
Pompey (l fill-oa),

Finally, Cicero concludes with urging that, in accordauce with the judgroent 01
the people, Pompey should be appointed to tbe command 01 the army against
Mithridates 11 03), especially because 110 possessos the seli-control which is ne·
cessaryin an Asiatic war 11 111-117), lle then offsets to tlie authority ol llor-
tensius and Catulus the views of other distinguished men who had supported
the Manilian bill (t 181 11 last, praise 01 Manilius 101 his 11111, eneouragemeut to
perseverance, and, with the promise ot his support, the most solemn assurance
also that tire orator bas been intluenced solely by the good 01 the state to de·
tend this bill aud cause (1 0001111).
