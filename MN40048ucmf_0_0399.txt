the inimortal gods, whose presence and 110111-111111 11111 signally displayed

The point 01 inquiry is, not whether Clodius was killed by 11110101 that is
consessed4 but whether 111111511011111111111111111111, This Cicero ninintains
in the affirmative, by laying down a general proposition, that it is lawiul to
ind the man, who lies in wait and attempts 1ο hill you,

This general proposition he proves,—

lst. From the authority os 1111 people, from former trials‚ and 110111 the 11115
in being.

2d. From thesilence 01 the laws passed on that occasion, either by the senate

Having established this general proposition, the orator proceeds 10 prove that
Clodius comes precisely under that description ; this he does,—

lst. From the advantages that were 10 11151 10 ibe deceased by the death 01
Milo.

cd. From the declared hatred he always expressed against 11110.

sd. From the criminal behavicr 011111 deceased through all the scenes 01 ius
