8.1111talia. Milo went, as is hnown,tolllarseilles. Uponsuch

voluntary exile, ensued a decree of the people, declaring the exile
just, and pronouncing the aquae et ignis interdictio. This involved
the loss of the civitas. An exile could not therefore romain in Italy,
because the 1011 Plautia Papiria n. u. 0. 665 had extended the Roman
civitas over all Italy. For the same reason the wearing of the toga,
the distinctiva dress of 1110 Roman citizen, was not allowed. Plin. Ep.
4,11,3: Carent enirn jure toga, 1111111110 aqua et igni interdictam
est. In some cases, as in that 01 Cicero, the distance from Rome to
which one was exiled was tired-Sepulcrum. At 1110 close of the
oration for Cluentius, ch. 71, 201, Cicero says: Nunc aera qnid erit
profectam, nisi nt liujus en meditamentis insidiis uita ad luctum
conservata, mors sepulcra patris privata esse videatur. Tho impor-
tauce attached to a burial in one’s native land, may be seen exempli-
fied in the prayer of Hector to Achilles, Il. 22, 254; of Mezentius,

often forms only the antithesis to laetari, and therefore = to ha moved,

posed to latitia, and its proper meaning must not he urged. Tears
are in Cicero often a rhetorical artifice: they give 10 the words the

make perhaps an impressicn direetly opposite to that which Cicero hy
