voluntury exile, ensued a decree of the people, declaring the exile
just, and prououucing the aqure et ignis interdictio. This involved
the loss of the civitas. An exile ceule not therefore remain in Italy,
because the lex Plautia Papiria A. u. c. 665 had entended the Roman
civitas over all Italy. For the same reason the wearing of the toga,
the distinctiva dress of the Romnn citizen, was not allowed. Pliu. Ep.
4, 11, 3: Carent euim jure toga, quilius aqua et igni interdictam
est. In some cases, as in that of Cicero, the distance from Rome to
which one was exiled was tired—Sepulcrum. At the close of the
orationfor Cluentius, ch. 71, 201, Cicero says: Nunc aera qaia erit
profectam, nisi ut liujus ca mediis lueriis insidiis cita ad laetam
conservata, ruore sepulcro patris privata esee videatur. The impor-
tance attached to a burial in one's native land, may be seen exempli-
fied in the prayer of Hector to Aclrilles‚1l. 22, 2543 of Mezentius,

often forms only the antithesis tolerari, and therefore = to be moved,
affected even to tears. So the substantive lacrima often stands op-
posed to latitia, and its proper meaning must nothe urged. Tears
are in Cicero often a rhetorical artifice: they give to the words the
requisite pathos. Upon cur minds nn orator by such appeals would
make perhaps an impressiou directly opposite to that which Cicero by
this means produced upon the minds of the judges and the andieuoe (co-
rona); bnt among the Greeks and Romans tears were the natural ex-
pression ofpaiu and emotion. They felt keeuly‚ aud the expressione
of their feeliugs were strong. Etiquette did not require them to sup·
press the loud outbreak of pain, or silent tears, aud cuslom did not com-
