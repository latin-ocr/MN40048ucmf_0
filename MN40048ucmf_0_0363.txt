Cicero sought in the personal character of the accused, and laid before the
judges, who could 1101 well sacrifice the cause of learning and humanity to
such an accusation-such a defence could not somuch urge the legal points at
issue, for which, as wc have already observed, the docnmcnts were wanting,
as set forth the praise of varied acquiremcnts, and 01 a life devoted 10 the cnl-
tivation 01 the beautiful 11111 is this very praise of the 1010001110 that
makes this speech a usefnl, agreeable, and inciting study to young readers3
though it must not be left uniioticed, that some critics consider it as spurious,
and unworthy 01 Cicero; arrd the ancients themselves regard it 00100εο1001-
lent than other orations¹ Respecting the result 01 1110 speech, which was de-
livered 111 111. c. 1111, before Q. Cicero¹ who vyas 11100 praetor urbanus, nothing
is kunnun, and the remaining period of ilrcliias’s life is buried in 0110101000ῑί-
ty. Tojndge 110111 the 10111 specimens 01 1110 poetrywhich have 001110 down
to ns, il appears that he did not possess so very great a poetical ialent as Cicero
describes it iu his oration; and it is probable that 1110111110, who evas intimate
with so rnauy Roman familias, was more particularly shilled in making verses
upon the passing events of the day, and also, assome believe, knew how to
maire himself agreeable by improvisation, or extemporo composition 01 verses.

ANALYSIS.

l. Tun introduction gives the reason which decided the orator to defend the
poet, and at the same time contains his apology for speahing of the advari·
tages of letters in a trial at law. (Chaps. l, 2, 1 a)

2. The leading proposition states the two points 01 his defence: that Archias,
who was already a Roman citizen, should not only not be deprived of his
franchise, but, eren ii he were not a citizen, the franchise should be con·
ferred upon him. (Ch. 2, 1 a) ‚

3. A description follows 01 the origin, acquired fante, and trnvels of the poet;
showing, that, as he cartre 10 Rome froin these trayels in Asia llinor, Greece,
and Italy, the most distinguished rnen and families honored him with their
friendship and society, and that Lucullus aided him to obtain the Roman
franchise. (1 4-011 4, 1 7.)

4, Cicero nent proceeds to the two points of his defence. and refutes 10) the
grounds upon which the accuser had procceded against Archias. and estab-
lishes :irchias's Roman citizenship, since lie had been a citizen in Heraclia,
anallied'tovrn, and accordingly by the law of Silvanus and Carbo had been
received in Rome as a citizen, he haring long before had 0 domicile in
Rome, and given in his name to the prator within 61 days. and having more-
over exercised the rights of Roman citizens, at the sanie time the charge of
the accuser, that Archias was not enrolled in the census lists, is set asido,
(1 1-011. 6.) (1) 10011101 to show that Archias was worthy 01 Roman citi-
zenship, he first speaks of the advantages 01 letters, and especially of poet-
ry (ch. 6, 1 13-011. 7, tibi: he then describes the eminent poetic taient 01
Archias, and shows by examples how highly poets were esteemed by an
tiquity3 he then enlarges upon the merit of Archias and his clainis upon
the Roman people acquired by his celebration in verse 01 the decds of em-

man name, and mentions many great rnen who, from their love of glory,
