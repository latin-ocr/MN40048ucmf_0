who lavored Clodius, refused to undertahe his defenee. lt was, therefore, ne-

praetorship 011110 ensuing year. Each strove to hinder the election of the eth-
er. They collected armed bands of slaves and gladiatore, and the streets of
Rome became the scene of fresh turnare and frays, in one 01 which Cicero
himself avers endangered. When the consuls endeavored to hold the comitia,
Clodius fell upon them with his band, and one 01 them, Cn. Domitius, was
wounded. The senate met to deliberate. Clodius spele, and attached Cicero
aad hlilo, touching, among other things, upon the amount of debt with which
the latter was burdened. Cicero, to whom hlilo’s electiori was 01 vital import-
ance, defended himin the speech De cere alieno Milonis, 01 which a few frag-
menis are still entant. The contest, however, evas soon after brought to a
