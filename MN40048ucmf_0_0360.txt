ἃ 32. In privatis, i. o. in privatos collata atque ita in iis conspicua,
, so in the 1101111110 iu regibus. Sco 11010 011 p. 88, 11110 37.

“ 34. Sartctum· For kings woro thought to be under 1110010100-

, tion 01 tho gods-Sociorum . . . . regam . i . . curialissimum. This

l might be designed by Cicero as hinting to Caesar, that his present titles

t might satisiy himself. This oration iras delivered late iu the year tou.
In the following February, 1110111 Antony offered Caesar thc diadem.

Cu. 1111-31, Posteris . . . . . tradituros. Deiotarus died, ac-

cording to Dion Cass. 48, 33, a. u. c. 111, but without leaving his do-
minious 10 his son. Castor suceecdcd him in Galatia, which was al-
} terwards bestowed by Antony on Amyntas, 111101 1115 death it 11110

38. Corpora. Either as surches, or to suffer any punishment
awarded against their master. Klotz omits esse 1101010 confido.

42. Regum 010101551ιηί. Matthiae and Benecke, with Emesti,
take anricissimi arrd probuti in the nominative, and explain regum 01
Deiotarus and iris family (Benecke, Deiotarus and his son, as in 0 41)),
just as Brutus is said to have expelled the liuga 01 Rome. Weiske
objected to this explanation, and taking regum as :inter reges, he
considers urreieissimi and probuti as genitivos. By this view, Dorylaus
est legatus amicissimi regum siue regis praeter ceteros addicti fide erga
populum Romanum. This king, Weiske supposes, may have been
Ariobarzanes, tho sovereign 01 Cappadocia.

43. Exquire de Blesamio. As the weight 01 the prosecution
lay in the testimony of Phidippus, Cicero wished to conclude with im-
pressing on the mind of Caesar the opposing testimonies 01 11101101 in-
tegrity. Ahovo,oh.12, the charge against Blesamius is giren and
ret'uted.

minantibus, accusantibns; Benecke 101 ablativos: in those aecusa-
lions.

2. Memoriam. . . . qua vates. Cf. p. Lig. 12, 35: qui obliuisci
nihii solea, hiri iujurias,· Phil. 2, 45, 116: Fuit in illo ingenium,
ratio, memoria, dae. Seneca, de Beneflc 5, 24, tells a pleasing story
01 Caesar’s memory.

4· Pedem· Z. 395. As Hieras never lest you, he is 1110101010
qualifiod to decide on the trnth 01 the charge. He attended you both
during your stay iu the palaee, and the next day at Luceium. As
11011001 the atterupts charged could have 1100111001101111110111 his pri-
