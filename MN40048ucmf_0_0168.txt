6. Locus. The temple of Jupiter Stator at tho soot of the Pala·
tine. See infr. ch. 5, 11, and 2, 6, 12. The regular meetings os the
, senate were held on the calends, nones, and ides of each mouth, and
commonly in the Curia Hostilia. Extraordinnry meetings (senatus
indictae) might be called on other days, and vvere often held in templee‚
or some other place inaugurated by the angnrs for tho purpose-Mu·
nitissimne. From its position as well as from the special guard set
there on this occasion-Horum oro vultusque. All the senators rose
up and left the bench on which Catiline seated himself. Comp. below,
ch. 7, 16, 17, and 2, 6,12. The words oro and vultus are osten
found in connection. They both denote the conntenance as making
known tho state os the mind-oe more the natural and habitual state,
asindicated by the expression of the mouth and lower part of the face:
volan rather the temporary and changing state, as expressed by tho
motion of the eye and brow. ,

t. nauseans. Orelli (od Vera. 4, 9, 19) states very clearly and
neatly the difference between non and nonne in direct questions: ¹‘ nbi
dico non-est? certus sententiae mere adversarii responsum non curo;
ubi interrogo nonne-est? opto atque exspecto enm, quem interrogo,
mihi assensnmm. In illo igitur major vis inest.¹’ Hand (Ture. iv.
p. 309) says, “Is qui pernen quaerit, supponit negationem in alterins,
quocum loquitur, sententia, qnam alter respondendo, ant pronuntiat,
ant rejicit affirmans contrarium—Utuntur hac dictione indignabundi,
aut irascentes, ant adinirontes.”

8. constrictam . . . . teneri· See Z. 1 592. The metaphor is
taken nom chaining a wild beast, to which lre compares the conspi-
racy. Cf. Phil. 7, 6, 273 Sese. 7, 16.

9. Quin proxima, qnid superiore· The “nox superior” here
mentioned is thesemo as that called “prior,” §83 viz. the night
which followed the day aster tho nones of November‚-the night be-
tweenNov. 6 and 7. The conspirators were then assembled in the
house of M. Porcius Laeea; 0114, p 83 pro Sulla, 16, 52. Tho “nox
proxima” is os course the night between Nov. 7 and Β. In what way
Catiline was engaged on this night we 110 not insormed.—-Comp. Arch.
5, 11, proximis censoribus-superindene—primis.

10. Quos convocaveris. See Sall. Cot. 17. Muretus has collected
from ancient authorities the names of sorty persons connected with the

conspiracy-Quid consilii. See ch. 4, 93 Sall. Cat. 27, 283 and
pro Setia, 18, 52.

11. arbitraris. See Z. 166.

13. vivite Immo vero. If a word only is to be corrected, it
is done by putting that word into the form of a question with or with-
out dicam, and answen'ng it by imino. So ad Aa. 12, 43: Ferendus
