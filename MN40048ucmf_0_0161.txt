00 the 1111, when the llight 01 Catiline was 10101111, Cicero delivered his sec
ond speech, wlrieh was addressed 10 the people in the terum. The senate pro·
ceeded to declara Catilina and Manlius ruthe enemim, dispatehed officere 01
high standing to Etruria, Picenum, Campania, Apulia, and the different dis·
triete from which danger was apprehended, directed the consuls to hold a lery
with all epced, decreed that Antonius should go 101111 10 the war, and 11101
Cicero should remain to guard the city3 01011115,τ attha samo time an amncsty

01 the 00111ρί101010 within the tyalls. lt is aremarhable fact, end one which
indicates most strongly the disaffeetion 01 the lower classes to the existing or-
der cs things, that not one man could be found to taho advantage 01 this pro·
clarnation, and thatnotasingle soldier desertedsrom the rebel standard. This
circumstance threatened to prove a source 01 most serious embarrasment.
although the existence ot the conspiracy and 111011οω0001 the leading con-
spiratore were known‚not only to the magistrates butte the public at large, yet
there was no legal evidence against any mdividual 3 for Curius, while he faith-
1011100001εά0001011110111101100, could not corne forward openly without blast·
ing himself ioreuer, and at the same time depriving the government 01 ite
most potuerint auxiliary. But ench stoadfastness 01 purpose did not extend to
certain foreigners belonging to araee proverbial in ancient times ior the light-
ness 01 their saith. There ruas at Rome at this period a party 01 Adobrogee,
deputies dispatched by their nation to seelrreliet' 110111 00110111 real or alleged
grievances. Their suit, however, had not prospered, and their complaints 01 the
eupidity 01 the magistrates and 01 the incinerenee 01 the senate were open and
lond. Lentulus, coneeiuing that their discertent might be made avallable 101
his own perpesse, opened a negotiation through the medium 01 P. Umbrenus, 0

might obtain ample redress. F inding that these mysterious hints ruere greedily
caught up, he gradually diselosed the nature 01 1110 plot, and invited them te
cru-operate byatirnulating their countrymen 10 insurrection. The men 101 a

the chauces, they resolved 10 secure a certahr and immediate recompensa,
rather than to speculata upon doubtful aud distant advantages. Accordingly,
they revcaled all to Q. Fabius Sanga, the patron 01 their state, who in his turn
ecunainted Cicero, arrd by the instructions 01 the latter enjoined 1110011111οξ0-

was placed in their hands, and they quitted Rome soon attermidnight 011 1110
