neque iernen, dcc.

26. extorta, viz. by the precautions taken to thwart your meas·
ures3 in reference to the preceding tries petitiones . . . . effugi.

2⁸1. Excidit casu alique. Cr. d 15: serianum populi Romani
obstitisse—Ei elapso est, = et ita elapsa est.

23. [Tamen....non pstea] These words are omitted by
Matthiie and Madvig. As above, [nihil egis]¹ [nitu moliris] rnay

rnay seem to have been taken from ch. 9, §24 Benecke, Klotz, and
Siipfle retain and dolend thena.

29. ruitura sacrIS. &a That a dagger or other weapon might
execute successfully the purpose it was to ho used scr, its owner used
indevotae, as it vvere, to that purpose hy some solemn ritee, accom-
panied with a vow, that, aster the accomplishrnent ol it, he would offer
it up to seme god. Thus Justin. 9, 7, 13; Olympius gladium, qao
ree percussus est, Apollini snb ncrrrine Myrtale-s consecrauit. Suet.
Gar. 24 (exin), tres gladios iu necem suem praeparatos Marti ultori,
addito elogio, consecravit. So Vitell. iu-Necesse putas esse. Be-
necke remarks that csse is very seldom omitted with necesse. What
are the constructione os necesse est? Z. 608 and 625. With necesse
estin Cicero the irpinitive and srrhjunctice appear to be equally lra-
quent; with oportet the infinitiue is much the more common.

Cn. Vri-33. (lure tihi nulla = “none of which.’¹ Nullus
for non. See Z. 688. It is however more emphatic, meaning ‘⁶ ncne
at all‚’' ‘¹ net a particle.’¹ So ‘⁵ nono of my worde,” not nullum dic-
torum rneorurn, hut nullum meum edicturm· so uuum uerbum ruunt,

they saw their friends or eminent meu approaching, to rise np and sa-
lute them, and conrteously address thern. For an interesting illustra-
tion of this mark ol Roman politeuess‚see de Repub. l, chaps. 9-12.

this arrangement ol contrasted words, see P. G. p. 14, ᾧ 15, b, and
p. 242, d 5. What is this figure called?

37. Quia. seezarue.
