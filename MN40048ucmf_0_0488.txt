The present hlannel 01 Greek aad Roman Antiquities is sar superior to any thing onthe
satne topics as yet offered to the American puhlie. A principal Review 01 Germnny says :—

‘⁵ Ι found on my table aster a short absence from home, your edition 01 onesenls Greek and
Roman antiqnities. Prayaccept my achnowledgmems 101 it. l am aereealtly surprisetl to
lind on enamining it, that within so very narrow a compass 101 so comprehensive a subiect, the
boch contains so much valualtle matter·y anti, indeed. so t‘nr as t see, omits noticing no topics es·
10111101. 11 will he a very usesul hook in Schools and Collegesmnd it is t'er superior to any thing
that llmow 01 the same kind. Besides being checp and accessihle to all studente, it hes the
great merit osdiseussing its topics iu a consecutive ond connected manner.'¹

Eelroet of o letter from Prty'eseor Tylery of matters( College.

perspictrons; well adopted tiir use in the needenty or the cottegennd cotnprehentling ina
