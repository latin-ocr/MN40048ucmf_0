and correct deciphering 01 the best MSS. 01 (licero's writings,
will he ready 10 admit, without hesitation, that if nothing more
should be attempted, 0 new and improved text was called 101.
The lahors 01 010111, Madvig, Klotz, and others, have not been
without important results 101 the 1011 01 Cicero, and no one
will deny that these results are 01 primary importance 10 be-
ginners in the study 01 the classice. The editor 1011 therefore
that he would render an essential service 10 the cause 01 accu-
rate scholarship, 11 he did nothing more than furnish a text 00
0011001 as possible. It was not his plan, however, to present
a 1011 which should be made up 01 several others, however
good, and correspond entirely with uo one. He was convinced
that it would more certainly meet the vn'ews 01 scholare and
teachers, 11 he should select the text which might he consid-
ered on the whole the best 101 his object, and give 00010101
and exact reprint 01 that. He 1100 accordingly intended in
this edition to give the text 01 Orelli, as revised by him sub-
sequently to his edition 01 the entire works 01 Cicero, and
published in avolume containing fifteen orations This 10-

those 101 Marcellus and 10111110, which are notlound in Orelli's
revision. The text 01 the Milo is 0 reprint 01 that 01 MadvigÍ¾
and 01 the 1101001100, 01 that 01 Klotz. The principa] varia-
11000, 10 the most recent editions, from the 1011, which has
been in either case adopted, are noticed in the notes. This
has been done often with what may at first sight appear unne-
cessary minuteness, but the editor is convinced that ateacher
may make use 01 various readings to the advantage 01 the pu-
pil, even at this stage 01 his progress.

The notes have been collected freely 11001 any sources which
were within the editor's reach. It will readily appear to those
who are acquainted with the subject that they have been largely
drawn from the productions of German scholarship. Those
which were given in Arnold's edition are here retained 1111011.
