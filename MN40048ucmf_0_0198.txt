30. Paruit, ivit. On the omission of et, see Z. 133. Klotz reads
pararit. Quint hesterno, &ei—Hesterno die. This statement is quite
irreconcilable with 1 Cot. M 1,3, 103 from which we necessarily
gather that Orat. Ι. was delivered on the 8111 of November, whereas,
from the present passage, it would appear to have been delivered on
11107111. 0. Druma1111,V0tV.p.oso‚ n.32,dates the delivcryof

Madvig, Opvoc. Ιλ pp, tas-96, inclines to the same dates.

31. ln sedem «Iovis Statoris· AEcles in the singular = a tem·

ified by some adjective expressed, or the genitive os the deity whose
temple is mentioned. Is more temples thau one sre spoken of, the
adjective or genitive determines the sense, as ‹edee scere, deornm.
