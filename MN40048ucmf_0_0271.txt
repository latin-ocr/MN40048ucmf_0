31. (2. Hortensius uvas so distinguished as an orntor, that Cicero
calls him (Dioirr. in Q. cecil. i) rez judiciorum. This deminution
over tlre courts continued up to about the year, u. c. 684, when Hor·
tensius was retained by Verres against Cicero. The issue ol this con-
test was to dethrone Hortensius, end to establish his rival, Cicero, as
the first orator and advocate ol the Roman iorum. Hortensius at·
tached himself closely 10 the dominant Sullane or aristocratic party,
and alter liis consulship, 1. u. c. 665, took a leading part in supporting
the optimates against the rising power of Pompey. Up to Cicero’s
consulship, 11. u. c. 691, Hortensius and Cicero were continually opposed,
prolesslonully and politically. Alter this period they usually acted to-

tinguished men (d 68), we can however for the present pass these by,
and seek the 1111111 from the merits os the case.”
