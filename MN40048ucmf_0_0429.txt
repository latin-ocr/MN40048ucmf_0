30. Diem . . . . dixerat. Diem dicere (nd populum) is tho corn-
nrencement of nn accusation in njadiciruu papuli, arrd belongs to rna·
gistrntes. The nreaniug ie to nppoint a day sor nppeuriug before the
pcople. It therefore corresponds to in jue uacare in the cnse of other
tribuunls. The tribunes threatened Cicero with it, because it ivae,
they alleged, ot his instigation that 111110 killed Clodius—lllultaiu ir—
rogarat. flfnltuut irrogare (for the most part in the coniitia tributa>
01001111010011111(1111110 correitia centuriata) formed the sequel of
the diem dicere. Hence the correspondingphrases pecunia anquirere,
and eapite anquirere. It ttius very conrrnon 101 the tribunes nt the

= coniitia tributa to propose a fine 101 magistrates or generale who had
transcendcd their duty or powers, or who had in general incurred any
liebllity in their office. Clodius had it iu his power to accuse Cicero
before the people, and call for a fine to he imposed upon him, in con-
sequence 01 his mensures against the Cetillnarian conspiraters 3 aud he
could also bring the aetio perduellionis against him (therefore capite
anquirere), because Cicero had, without sentence and without right,
executed Romen citizens, ns C. Rabirius was nrede perduellionis reus,

cedingline.

31. Quum mini adesset, meam causam sua prasentia et aucto·
ritate defenderet, ne in exsilium ejicerer. Adesse is often used in a
legal sense of the cauntenauce 01 support lent by a patronus er advo-
catus to a person in his trial, by his presence, advice, or his intluence
generally. The circumstances here referred to are given by D. Cass.
38, 16. The equites sent a cemmittee from their number, arrd the
senators sent Q. Hortensius and G. Curio to the consul Gabinius, to
engage him to interfere in favor 01 Cicero 3 but Gabinius rudely repulsed
them, and the messengers were maltreated by the Clodian mob.

39. Vitam amiserit· Asconius says thet Vibienus died on the
very day of the burning of the body 01 Clodius.

40· Stoa illa. This passage furnishes 110 evidence that Cicero
regarded Clodius es a sellam-conspirator with Catiline. The ambigu-
ity appears intentional. Cicero looked upon Clodius as a second Gati-
line.-—H‹ee intentata nohis eet, ante exsilium.
