ANALYSIS.

1, Tho introduction consists ot a continued aad well-sastained irony. Cicero
ridiculos 11111010, 101 bringing an nccrrsation against Ligarius before Cacsar,
on account of a rnattcr that is lraown to everybody; represents hirnscll as
stripped oi all rncans os tlcscacc, hythe charge oi so unheard oi a eritne,
astho haring heen in :lirica; aad proceeds to treat the whole accusation
as tritling aad conternptihlo, lle accordingly goes 011, ia suhtle aad covert
irony, lo arga that the disclosurc oi this crirne compels hirn to resort to
casus huuranhy as his only refuge ; hy which, he adds, 50 many already
hare heen preserved to their country, whom Crnsar has pardoned, not tor
any crime, hat only sor an crror, and arrrong thern 'l'uhero also. who how-
eret, as well as his father, has more to answer sor to Coesar, than Ligarius
who is charged hy them with a crime, irorn which they are not ahle to
clear themselves (1 11.)

9. The narration shows that Ligarius was in Africa, bnt without any sanlt
ol his own, aad not as essars enemy; ior,

(a) lle went as legate into the province 01 Atrica before tlte ontbrealr 01 war

(1) lle was constraiaed, when Considius withdraw, by the urgent wisi] oi
the inhabitants. against his will to assume the goaerament os thc province 3

(cl lle reinsed the command offered 10111111, bat was unable¹ hecorning in-
volved in the war, to escape srom the province. (13-5.) ,

3. The argument itselt has two parts: the first iawrlidates the charge oi the
accuser; the second comnreads Ligarius to Cacsar's mercy

(1) The orator introduces his proot os the wealrness ol 'l'uhero's accusation
by a panegyrici on Castu, sor haring spared him talio had been a Pompeian

(16-5), and then shows¹

(a) ilowuawise and inconsiderate the accusation is. since tho accuser had
actually fought against caesar, while the accused had only licen ia Africa
o 9. top

(1) How cruel and inhumari, since it airus at the death os Ligarius (1 11, ia),
or at least hinders his pardon (1 13, 141, a cruelty which Cicero purposely
depicts in the strongest colors (1 15, 161;

(c) ilow unremonable and 01111151, since 'labero has called the error of Liga-
rius treasom wherehy he reflects upon thewhole party of Poarpey,21ndeven
condemns his own aad his tather’s course (111-19); 111 respect to (111115
own joarney to africa, which was entered upon hy command ot‘ the senate

1 att-23). (2) his zealto deiend this province (12111111 (31 his firmness and
consistency, in supporting the party 01 the senate, evea alter his affront
(1 1126)(

(d) llow ahsnrd aad soolish it is, to desire that Caesar, who has pardoned
puhlic offences, should arenga private grierancesr (1 2¹0.)

(Ξ) lle directs his discourse to secure pardon for the accused, ana,

(α) In connection with praise oi Caesar. he makes iranh confession 01 his own
mistake and lauit (1 31]. 31);

(11 He draws a touching picture 01 the sorrow and distress 01 the brothers
aad kinsmen of Ligarius, who are present, aad have heen constant friends
oi Caesar (1 32-3t);

(c) He brietly sets fortir the merits os one of the brothers, Τ. Ligarius, tor ser-
vice done to Caesar, who now is reminded that he has it in his own power,
to show him a grateful recollection oi the favor (1 ³5, 36) ;
